# Teachers-Resource---Word-Scramble-8
This was a quick personal project to help my Fiancee in the classroom, you input 8 sets of words into the top text boxes and after hitting Scramble it outputs the scrambled words. 

This is aimed at Grades 2/3 (Or so I'm told.)

Includes: 
- Printer options for Master Worksheet and Student Worksheet. (With Answer Key/Without Answer Key)
- Scramble/Randomize Button
- 8 PreSet Boxes for words (If you'd like more/less boxes, please ask.)
- Space for Student Name/Date
- Form is sized 8.5 inches x 11.0 inches, the standard US paper size. (If you'd like this adjusted to another standard, please ask.)
- Space for writing answers in.

Potential Improvements:
- Make it pop more, if it's aimed at grades 2/3 then it may need to be more "fun?"
- Option to select how many Boxes you'd like?

Disclaimer: I'm not a teacher. I just made this for one.
